Dotfiles
========

Everyone has its own set of dotfiles. These are mine - based on Powerline. It shows you
- the virtualenv you're working in
- the branch you're on
- the state it's in: if every change is checked in, the amount of untracked files

Git
+++
I've also added a few handy git aliases:
- incoming: list incoming changes
- outgoing: what's only in here, but on on the remote(s)
- yolo: generate a commit message :-)
